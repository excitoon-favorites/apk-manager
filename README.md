### About APK-Manager
APK-Manager is a series of scripts to make developing Android apps easier. Currently, this project is only availible for Windows, but porting over to Bash is a work in progress.

Features:
- Decompile an APK File
- Compile an APK File from a source folder
- Sign an APK File (With the default signing keystore, or your own Keystore.)


### APK-Manager Requirements:
A Windows PC running:
- Windows 7
- Windows 8
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10

The Windows version of Apk-Manger has not been tested on WINE on Linux. Please, try it and let me know how it works.

In order to run properly, apk-manager requires the following components to be installed:
- Java jdk (Tested on V8 build 121)
- Java jre (Tested on V8 build 121)

### Developement notes
So far, we still have a couple bugs to kill, so we haven't released an offial build yet. 
The Windows version was developed and tested on:
- Windows 7 (With all updates installed)
- Windows 10 (Creators Update)

The (Very Incomplete) Linux version was developed and tested on:
- Ubuntu 16.04.2
- Ubuntu 17.04


There are many features lacking, such as a GUI. This program is not intended for use by the general public YET. We do plan on making the program much more feature-rich, and easier to use, along with automation support, to make it easier for non-developers.

What I need (and what you can contribute):
- Fixed Issues.
- A Build for Linux (Main Target: Ubuntu)
- A Build for Mac (Long Term Project)
- A Website. This will be hosted in this repository. I prefer following the Google Material Guidlines. Templates and examples availible at [GetMDL.io](https://getmdl.io)
- Repo Wiki. This includes How-Tos, and Install Instructions.
If you can offer any of this, please do. I would like to continue to develop Apk-Manager
