### Developement notes
So far, we still have a couple bugs to kill, so we haven't released an offial build yet. 
The Windows version was developed and tested on:
- Windows 7 (With all updates installed)
- Windows 10 (Creators Update)

The (Very Incomplete) Linux version was developed and tested on:
- Ubuntu 16.04.2
- Ubuntu 17.04


There are many features lacking, such as a GUI. This program is not intended for use by the general public YET. We do plan on making the program much more feature-rich, and easier to use, along with automation support, to make it easier for non-developers.

What I need (and what you can contribute):
- Fixed Issues.
- Licenses. If you can find the licenses for all other assets used in this project, that would be great.
- A Build for Linux (Main Target: Ubuntu)
- A Build for Mac (Long Term Project)
- Compatability tests for Windows Vista and Windows XP 

If you can offer any of this, please do. I would like to continue to develop Apk-Manager
