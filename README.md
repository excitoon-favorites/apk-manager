### About APK-Manager
APK-Manager is a series of scripts to make developing Android apps easier. Currently, this project is only availible for Windows, but porting over to Bash is a work in progress.

### Downloads
You can Download the offical build For Windows [Here](https://github.com/jordanbancino/apk-manager/raw/master/Downloads/Binaries/apk-manager_Install.exe)
The installer contains both portable and system installations.
NOTE! This binary is over a month old! For a fresh version, use the executable source code.

An Offical build for Linux is in progress.

- Java jdk (Tested on V8 build 121)
- Java jre (Tested on V8 build 121)

### Developement notes
So far, we still have a couple bugs to kill, so we haven't released an offial build yet. 
The Windows version was developed and tested on:
- Windows 7 (With all updates installed)
- Windows 10 (Creators Update)
The (Very Incomplete) Linux version was developed and tested on:
- Ubuntu 16.04.2
- Ubuntu 17.04

The last Windows binary was built over a month ago, and since then, Apk-Manager has changed a lot. Do not download this binary. Use the source code (as it is executable on a Windows computer) for the latest updates and bug fixes.
There are also many features lacking, such as a GUI. This program is not intended for use by the general public YET. We do plan on making the program much more feature-rich, and easier to use, along with automation support, to make it easier for non-developers.
