For all of this stuff to work, you need the java se and java jdk. The jdk is a very light install.

java -jar apktool.jar if App.apk
java -jar apktool.jar d App.apk

-Modify the contents of the created folder

java -jar apktool.jar b AppFolder

-APK is now located in AppFolder\Dist\
move .\AppFolder\Disk\App.apk AppRecompiled.apk

zipalign -v 4 NewAPK.apk FinalAPK.apk

- The jarsigner may not work. if this is the case, you can find the offical jarsigner at C:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x_xxx\bin\jarsigner.exe
-- The password for the key is "decompile"
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore sign.keystore final.apk Sign-Key

-To install the cracked apk, uninstall any current version on the device
adb install AppFinal.apk

-You have cracked an app
