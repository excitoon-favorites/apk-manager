### About APK-Manager
APK-Manager is a series of scripts to make developing Android apps easier. Currently, this project is only availible for Windows, but porting over to Bash is something that could easily be done by someone that understands how to convert batch files to bash scripts.

In fact, I am looking for someone that understands both Windows and Unix, so that these scripts could be translated to Unix. If you can think you can do this, just let me know by emailing me at <factshackstips@gmail.com>. Feel free to download the source code and translate it to bash, Then just email me a zip, and I can add it to the Repo
