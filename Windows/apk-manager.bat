echo Actions
echo         compile           Compiles, aligns, and signs an APK file from a source folder.
echo         decomile          Decompiles an apk file. Must argue valid APK file.
echo         help              Displays this page
echo         verify            Verifies that there are no file conflicts, everything is installed properly, and that the run in path contains no spaces. Does not require a file or path, as it only checks internal settings.
echo         install           Install an APK file to a connected device. This method uses ADB debugging, so you must have it enabled on your device.
echo         install-system    Installs %0 to the system to be used in any location.
echo.
echo File or Path 
echo              Use path when using compile action. Path contains the assets and code of the Android App.
echo              Use file when using decomile action. This must be a valid APK file.
